# palindrome
A program that will read in a series of characters; only 80 characters at most. It will remove all spaces and punctuation and check to see if the input is the same backwards as it is forwards. If it is a palindrome (the same backwards and forwards), it will print “Palindrome”.  If not, it will print “Not a palindrome.” It will compare letters across lettercases.
